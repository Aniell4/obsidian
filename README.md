I'm making this public because it feels like you guys should all know what i am taking, it doesn't matter to me, i habe no t changed as a person, i have just grown, my friends say i have become the worst imaginable thing in the planet, when i was just trying to cope with loneliness by being with then, yes, yesh gumi, you do not deserve me, goodbye.

If i ever get hospitalized, i will probably stop uploading here.

To everyone who cares about me, this is my medication, you do not have any say in what i should and shouln't do, i have done a lot of introspection, and who are YOU, to say what is better for me?, i will not be left alone if someone truly cares for me, they will realize this is me, and they will accept me for who i am.

to you gumi, you are a toxic piece of shit, who never realizes anything. you live in yur own world, and say that shit back to me like if i was the oen in the wrong, you just don't get it do you?
so goodbye, you have never known me better than myself, that is egocentrical of you to say such a thing.

to everyone else, i care for you, come to me and ask me for help, i will try to my limits, i have problems with undestranding emotions, i am going to do therapy, i am going to become a better person, but not for anybody else than me in foremost, in second, the ones i love. which i will not be putting here because of shame.
