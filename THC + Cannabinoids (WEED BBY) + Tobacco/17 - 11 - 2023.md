* 01:40? - smoked 2 joins, first one i didn't get as much because i rolled incorrectly (put too much and so it didn't close well), i just lost most of the smoke and contents, and i also almost hurt myself with the flames because i lit it too much other than the other mistakes. the next roll i blunt i put way less stuff in it, and so managed to close it correctly. then also lit slowly, and so i got so much more and i still got around 3/4th left put away because i was feeling bad from all the hot smoke. but i still think this might be the biggest smoke, if not well still will get a bit of effects, i'm still not ready to smoke all of it it's too bad on my lungs, like it literally hurts xd
