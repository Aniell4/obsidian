* 11:06 - took 300mg freebase dxm (robocough), taking it orally made me want to throw up as always
* 11:57 - i threw up, i wonder if i will even trip at this point, did i throw everything up? no clue, i didn't see much in the vomit but it might be dissolved there.
* 13:28 - feel better now, i ate a bit and now i don't feel nausea anymore. plus i feel energized and in a good way, not the psychedelic stoning way.
* 16:47 - most effects gone
