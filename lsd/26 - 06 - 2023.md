## dosed 400ug 1P-LSD

###### i took around 300ug 4 days ago, so i probably have a bunch of tolerance.

* 4:05 - put 4 blotters in my mouth
* 4:30 - spitting out blotters
* 4:35 - already coming up
* 4:57 - feeling like i have to punch my stomach, it's so gelatinous.... also getting a bunch of visual distortion already
* 5:26 - wo, so little time has passed? visual distrortion is way stronger, i might need to calm myself with some music, my stomach is really acting weird.
